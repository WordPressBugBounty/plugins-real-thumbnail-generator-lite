== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does "Custom upload structure" mean? =
The custom upload structure can be easily set in the media settings of the Pro version. Here is a little example how the WP standard upload looks like:
wp-content/uploads/2016/11/myimage-150×150.jpg
... and after you set a custom upload structure it can look like: 
wp-content/uploads/2016/11/thumbnails/medium/myimage.jpg

= Inspection of plugin source files =

Most plugin files (PHP, templates, assets) are in the ZIP in human-friendly, unprocessed form (soure files).

The plugin’s JavaScript/TypeScript is bundled (e.g. by Webpack) from plugin-specific packages and third-party open source to produce build files. Each build ends with `//# sourceMappingURL=…` to source maps with the original, human-readable code; these maps are public and the included source code can be inspected by anyone directly in your browser, if you have installed the plugin.

To conveniently view the complete codebase of the consumed script in e.g. Chromium/Google Chrome, open *⋮ > More tools > Developer tools > ⋮ (in DevTools) > Settings > Preferences > Sources* and enable "JavaScript source maps", "CSS source maps", and "Allow DevTools to load resources, such as source maps, from remote file paths". Reload, then open *DevTools > Sources > "devowl-local-files"* to inspect all readable sources.

Source maps are hosted outside the ZIP to keep size manageable; otherwise the plugin could exceed limits of web hosts and become non-installable.

The repository with all source files can be do be inspected by anyone at [assets.devowl.io/wordpress-plugins-source-code.zip](https://assets.devowl.io/wordpress-plugins-source-code.zip). Please check out the `README.md` in the repository to learn how to get started!
